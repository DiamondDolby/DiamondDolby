## 👨‍💻 About Me
I'm a detail-driven developer turning ideas into intelligent systems. I love mixing code with real-world impact — from autonomous robots to eye-tracking proctoring tools.  
Currently building smart solutions with **MediaPipe**, **OpenCV**, and embedded systems.  
Let’s just say if it moves, tracks, or computes, I probably built it 😄

---

## 🤖 Robotics & Automation
- Developed **multiple autonomous robots** using `Arduino`, `Python`, `C++`, and `Java`
- Built systems for **navigation**, **environmental monitoring**, and **task automation**
- Hands-on experience in **sensor fusion**, **embedded systems**, and **real-life problem solving**
